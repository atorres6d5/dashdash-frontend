# Dash-Dash



Dash Dash Is an alarm clock that helps make hitting the snooze button more tangible. A user is asked a few questions when making their account for the first time and an alarm is made for them based on their answers. They can customize their alarm to their liking, and create new ones too.


# How it Works

Many of us don't just have one alarm. We have our first alarm to make us alert, the second one to tell us we really need to get out of bed, and sometimes one that tells us "If I haven't left yet, I'm going to be late!" Dash Dash puts all of your alarms into one schedule of alarms. letting you know if you are on track to make it to your activity on time.
